Project Overview

AirSuraksha is designed to increase public awareness by presenting complex air quality data through interactive charts and comparative analyses. The application targets not only general users but also researchers and policymakers looking to better understand pollution trends. This project reflects my ability to integrate data science with web development and cloud technologies.

Key Features

Interactive Visualizations:
Explore air quality data through dynamic charts and graphs to gain insights into pollution trends over time.

City Comparisons:
Compare air quality indices (AQI) across multiple cities to assess regional variations and identify pollution hotspots.

Temporal Analysis:
Observe how air quality fluctuates over specific periods—daily, monthly, or annually—to detect patterns and anomalies.

Correlation with Meteorological Data:
Analyze how factors like temperature and humidity influence pollution levels, providing a deeper understanding of environmental impacts.
